== Asciidoc configfiles

=== Adopted from intellij plugin
The intellij plugin supports project specific configuration files 
(see https://intellij-asciidoc-plugin.ahus1.de/docs/users-guide/features/advanced/asciidoctorconfig-file.html) 
It's a very clever approach, because it's possible to fine tune IDE behaviour.


=== Why was this adopted/necessary?
Inside the Eclipse asciidoctor Plugin the same feature is now available. 
It was was reused, to enable teams where IntellIJ and Eclipse is used both to have one common
config file. But this does also solve many problems inside eclipse plugin when it comes to 
images and their locations!

NOTE: For more details about the feature and the origin spec from intellij please 
visit https://github.com/de-jcup/eclipse-asciidoctor-editor/issues/314 


=== File names

The config files can be:

 * `.asciidoctorconfig` (origin filename but does not handle ifndef etc.)
 * `.asciidoctorconfig.adoc` This will work the same way like `.asciidoctorconfig` but supports preprocessor macros like ifndef

=== Locations
Every project folder can contain such a configuration file which is
accepted by IDE. 

=== Purpose
Inside these files we can set attributes. The files are hierarchical and are cummulated, but
the nearest config file wins.

=== Special attributes
- `asciidoctorconfigdir` is a synthetic attribute, injected automatically by IDE. It contains the location of the nearest configuration file

=== Options
It is also possible to set some options by the configuration file as well:
[options="header"]
|===
|Option   |Descripiton   
//----------------------
|base_dir |change the base_dir used for rendering +
For example:
`:base_dir: {asciidoctorconfigdir}` would change the base directory to the current asciidoctor config file path
|===


=== Example
Here an example were we define some variables and also set the imagesdir, so we need no
relative pathes etc.

==== Structure
Let's assume following situation:
----

 +testproject
   |__docs
       |__asciidoc/
       |   |__folder2/
       |   |   |_test2.adoc
       |   |__folder3/
       |   |   |_asciidoctorconfig.adoc
       |   |   |_test3.adoc
       |   |__another-image-folder/
       |   |  |_example-B.jpg
       |   |_test1.adoc
       |__images/
       |   |_example-A.jpg
       |_.asciidoctorconfig.adoc
   

----

==== Two config files
Inside `testproject/asciidoc/.asciidoctorconfig.adoc` we have:

[source,asciidoc] 
----
:my-var1: i am from root folder!//<1>
:my-var2: i am from root folder! //<2>
:imagesdir: {asciidoctorconfigdir}/images //<3>
----
<1> Here we set just a custom variable `my-var1`
<2> Here we set just a custom variable `my-var2`
<3> This defines the `imagesdir` attribute

Inside `testproject/asciidoc/folder3/.asciidoctorconfig.adoc` we have:
[source,asciidoc] 
----
:my-var2: i am from var2-folder3 - and overwrites root def! //<1>
:my-var3: i am from var3-folder3 //<2>

:imagesdir: {asciidoctorconfigdir}/../another-image-folder
----
<1> Here we overwrite custom variable `my-var2` which originally comes 
    from `testproject/asciidoc/.asciidoctorconfig.adoc`
<2> Here we set a new custom variable `my-var3`
<3> This redefines the `imagesdir` attribute and overwrites
    `testproject/asciidoc/.asciidoctorconfig.adoc` setup

==== 3 Asciidoc files, all same content but different behaviour/output
So having `test1.adoc`, `test2.adoc` and also `test3.adoc` all containing 

[source,asciidoc]
---- 
=== Example
var1 = {my-var1}
var2 = {my-var2}
var3 = {my-var3}
image::example-A.jpg[]
image::example-B.jpg[] 
----

This would show for `test1.adoc` and `test2.adoc`:
----
var1=i am from root folder!
var2=i am from root folder!
var3=
----
and the image of `example-A.jpg` will be visible but not found for `example-B.jpg`

But for `test3.adoc` the output would be 
----
var1=i am from root folder!
var2=i am from var2-folder3 - and overwrites root def! 
var3=i am from var3-folder3
----
and the image of `example-A.jpg` will NOT be visible/found, but `example-B.jpg` would be visible
