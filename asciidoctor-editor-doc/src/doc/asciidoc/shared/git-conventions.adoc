=== GIT conventions

==== References to issue
Every commit shall be related to an existing GitHub issue at 
https://github.com/de-jcup/eclipse-asciidoctor-editor/issues.

An example to reference an issue at the commit message title:

```
Improved architecture and developer doc #371
```

==== Multi line commit messages
We handle multi line commit messages as suggested at
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#_discussion:

> ...
 Though not required, itâ€™s a good idea to begin the commit message
 with a single short (less than 50 character) line 
 summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and 
 then a more thorough description. 
 The text up to the first blank line in a commit message is treated 
 as the commit title, and that title is used throughout Git
 ...

==== Feature branches and PRs
We use feature branches and doing reviews via PRs.

==== Standard setup for GIT
```
git config branch.autosetuprebase always
git config branch.master.rebase true
git config push.default current
git config core.autocrlf input
git config color.ui auto
git config --add remote.origin.fetch +refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*
```
