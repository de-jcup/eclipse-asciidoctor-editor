== README

Inside this folder scripts can be found which do execute some simple asciidoctor rendering with native
installed asciidoctor instance.

The purpose for those files is to check standard behaviour of asciidoctor outside.
So we can check if works "native" and only not inside editor or if its a general asciidoctor problem/situation.
